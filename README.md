Social Network
=========================

My social network doesn't look pretty but it has a lot of new texhnologies for me. It's my first **React** project, I also had a lot of fun with **Redux**, real **PostgreSQL** requests (much more and complicated then in my "Image Board"), messages work on **Socket.io**. And I also fell in love with React:)

* After registration you will see your profile page where you can change the profile picture and write your bio.

* Then you abble to see everybody who is online. It works through **Socket.io**, means when someone logsin or leaves the site you will see it immediately.
* Here you also can send to somebody friend request, cancel your friendship, accept or reject some other people friends requests (depends on the qurent friend status)

* In the global chat you can talk to everybody on this web site and after click on user you will be redirected to their profile page.
* All messages here and also in private messages also work through **Socket.io**, so users will see your message immediately after sending.

* This is a page of another user profile. You can see users info and also manage the friend status.
