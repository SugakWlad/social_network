Social Network
=========================

My social network has a lot of new texhnologies for me. It's my first **React** project, I also had a lot of fun with **Redux**, real **PostgreSQL** work and messages work on **Socket.io**. And I also fell in love with React:)

* After registration you will see your profile page where you can change the profile picture and write your bio.

* Then you are able to see everybody who is online. It works through **Socket.io**, which means when someone logs in or leaves the site you will see it immediately.
* Here you also can send to somebody a friend request, cancel your friendship, accept or reject some other people's friends requests (depends on the current friend status)

* In the global chat you can talk to everybody on this web site and after click on the user you will be redirected to their profile page.
* All messages here and also in private messages also work through **Socket.io**, so users will see your message immediately after sending.

* This is a page of another user profile. You can see users info and also manage the friend status.

* It's a private messages page where you can see people you already had private messages with.

* You can choose one of them and continue the conversation.

* Here is a friends page where you can see all people who are your friends and people who sent you or received from you a friend request.
